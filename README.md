# ottonova-challenge

**This is not an official Ottonova website. It is a simple mock contact page for a job application.**  
  
I tried to challenge myself and build this website from scratch with only plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, since I hadn't done it in a while. Webpack provides bundling for performance.  
  
It was a really fun experience, allthough I will definitely not do something like this again. Modern frameworks,libraries and preprocessors are there for a reason. I couldn't help but think about how much easier this would have been with React. I learned a lot though and can appreciate things that I took for granted a lot more.

Thanks to [Ottonova](https://www.ottonova.tech/) for the challenge. I wish more companies would include coding challenged in their application process.
